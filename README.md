# 3D-Data-Fusion-and-Novel-View-Synthesis-using-LiDAR


Built calibration and alignment pipelines between RGB and LiDAR modalities using KITTI Odometry sequences.
* Implemented LiDAR-to-camera projection, forward splatting, z-buffering, and multi-view blending for geometry-based novel view
synthesis.
* Analyzed the impact of LiDAR sparsity and viewpoint distance on rendering quality using PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics.
* Explored neural extensions with depth-supervised NeRF and instant NGP to compare learned vs. explicit 3D reconstruction
methods.
